## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Presently connector blocks can only be powered by placing levers to the side of it (literally to the ground next to the block). This should change by allowing a connector block to be powered by a lever sitting ontop of the connector block itself / ideally it should also be able to hold torches or trapdoor items for decoration.
